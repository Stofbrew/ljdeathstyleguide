# ljdeathstyleguide

Hi there. 

We're working on some government services to help make things clearer for people who are experiencing the death of someone close to them.

This site is where we're keeping information about our content approach – how we write, how we organise, how we design.

It's built on a prototyping kit put together by @tjharrop. 

It's a living document – it grows and shifts through user testing.

It's us working in the open – feel free to share.

If you've got any questions, get in touch: chris.brew@finance.nsw.gov.au
